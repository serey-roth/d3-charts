# D3.js Charts

A collection of charts built using D3.js, a data-driven Javascript library. 

## What did I use?
I was enamored by the beautiful animated charts that one can build using d3.js and wanted to try my hands at them. I created the charts in this collection
using data provided by freeCodeCamp, and instructions in their data visualization assignments. Furthermore, I used code samples from [d3-graph-gallery](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/index.html) and the official d3 tutorial on Observable.

## What did I learn?
Through meaningful visualizations, we emphasize the important parts of the data that we are working with, which allow us to understand the data quickly 
and use them correctly. For most of the charts in this collection, the hardest part of the building process is understanding the structure and the key parts of their
corresponding data. For instance, to build the choropleth map, I had to read up on the structure of a topojson file and the difference between topojson and geojson files. There are many types of chart you can build so it is important that we learn how to distinguish them and pick the correct one to represent our data.
